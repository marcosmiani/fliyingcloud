# Getting Started with Flying cloud

Go to [the fliying cloud page](http://marcosmiani.github.io/fliyingcloud)

- Click the key (lower right corner)

- Set up the API keys:
    ```
    accuWeather: OiXgWYU0cN3gBRcw1HSb4pgzh5uAENlv
    tequilaKiwi: jJ6sf5YuzyW67WKlXviCPChvdfx9dX5z
    ```
 - Enjoy

## A brief explanation about the keys

_Im sure you are wondering why I didnt put the keys there.. well like all devs im worried about the mis-use of the keys if they are directly embebed into the app (web crawlers and other stuff). On the other side, I would like people to try it out, so if you are reading this here are the keys to enjoy the app. Both are free, so the only issue would be filling the quota and having to wait to use the app or.. making your own tokens._

## Case

Someone has a few days of holidays left, wants to travel to a familiar yet more confortable place, as cheap an as sunny as possible.

*The app solves this:*
Lets you choosing your starting point and your desired destinations, how many people its going to travel AND shows you trips with prices and estimated weather to those places. As cheap as the API can return for the current trips avaiable on a 5 day round holiday.

## Things I would improve given time

- More tests, both components and, specially, the state
- Hide the tokens on the API side or under authentication required
- A proper design way beyond the default components and colors, they always take time but they are worth it
- More linting and types (again, specially on the state)
- Rethink what the user wants to see about the weather when he travels (MORE ICONS)
- Explain more which dates are selected and why, (5 days because is the free and available.. for now)
- Create a presentation page, a _Hello and Welcome_ message
- Search by weather? Some people like snow, other sun, others.. rain or wind (surfing anybody?)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
